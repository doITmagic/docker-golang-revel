# docker-golang-revel
Docker Image for those using the GOLANG and REVEL framework

### You can build the image using the Dockerfile file or you can use the image from https://hub.docker.com/r/doitmagic/docker-golang-revel/

## How to use it:
#### CHANGE variables in /docker/config/supervisord/supervisor.conf, /docker/docker-compose.yml and run_example.sh
#### Put this 'docker' folder in your GOPATH
#### Put run_example.sh in your revel application folder
#### RUN 'docker-compose up -d' in 'docker' folder

That's all :)
